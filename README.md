============
This is a repository of several exercises taken from several sites, just for fun and answered fully in Scala.

Packages include my resolution to the exercises proposed by:

- [Codility for programmers](https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/)
- [Functional Programming in Scala](http://www.manning.com/bjarnason/), by Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason
- [Programming in Scala](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Scala-Comprehensive-Step---Step/dp/0981531644/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1426263350&sr=8-1&keywords=programming+in+scala), by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon and Bill Venners
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
- [Aperiodic](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/)

Exercises were tested in the REPL, worksheets and ScalaTest.
